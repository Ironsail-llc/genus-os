"""Guardrail soak monitor — surfaces would-block ("observed") counts per
guardrail so observe→enforce promotions are data-driven, plus the run
error/timeout rate. Run ad hoc or on a timer during a soak.

A guardrail is safe to flip to enforce when its `observed` count over a full
cron cycle is either 0 (injection_scan, sandbox_default with no host-fs agent)
or a hand-verified true-positive set (exec_allowlist). RBAC is already enforce.
