# Memory System

The memory system is Genus OS's core — a multi-store architecture where facts are extracted, deduplicated, scored, clustered into episodes, abstracted into procedures, and organized into a knowledge graph. Memory decays, strengthens, gets superseded, consolidates, and — when agents act on it unsuccessfully — self-invalidates.

## Stores

| Store | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `memory_facts` | Atomic distilled facts with lifecycle scoring (importance, decay, outcome_failures) |
| `memory_entities` | Knowledge graph nodes (person, project, tech, …) |
| `memory_relations` | Knowledge graph edges (uses, works_at, manages, …) |
| `memory_insights` | LLM-discovered cross-domain connections |
| `memory_episodes` | Time-bucketed event clusters (added 2026-04) |
| `memory_procedures` | Skill library — named playbooks with success/failure tracking (added 2026-04) |
| `memory_vault` | Verbatim Knowledge Vault — exact reference data, never paraphrased (added 2026-05, RIP 12) |
| `vault_access_log` | Audit trail for every Knowledge Vault value read (added 2026-05) |
| `memory_intents` | Prospective/intent memory — standing objectives the operator works toward (added 2026-05, RIP 14) |
| `agent_memory_blocks` | Named text blocks (persona, user_profile, preferences, self_model, …) |
| `agent_breadcrumbs` | 7-day cross-run scratchpad per agent (added 2026-04) |
| `chat_messages` | Verbatim conversation turns with embeddings + 90-day TTL (added 2026-04) |
| `fact_access_log` | Per-run retrieval audit for outcome attribution (added 2026-04) |
| `ingested_items` | Dedup tracking (content hash per source+item+tenant) |
| `ingestion_watermarks` | Per-source progress and error tracking |

All embedding columns are `vector(1024)` with HNSW indexes (m=16, ef_construction=200).
Active-row **partial** HNSW indexes (`idx_*_active`, migrations 073/074) keep
superseded vectors out of the candidate budget. pgvector **0.8.2** is installed;
every vector search applies shared session tuning via
`robothor/memory/vector_tuning.py` `apply_hnsw_session(cur)` —
`hnsw.ef_search=100` plus, when `MEMORY_HNSW_ITERATIVE=1`,
`hnsw.iterative_scan=relaxed_order` (fetches past the `WHERE` filter until `LIMIT`
is met — the robust fix for filtered-vector recall).

## Retrieval

`search_facts(query, …)` implements hybrid retrieval:

1. Vector search (HNSW cosine, top 30)
2. BM25 keyword search (GIN tsvector, top 30)
3. **Reciprocal Rank Fusion** (k=60)
4. Optional entity-graph expansion (follow relations)
5. Optional **cross-encoder reranker** (Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B) — on by default; kill-switch via `MEMORY_RERANK_ENABLED=0`
6. Optional appended `memory_insights`, `memory_episodes`, and verbatim `chat_messages` (low-weight RRF merge)

### Memory router (RIP 15)

The `search_memory` tool previously hard-coded `expand_entities + insights +
episodes = True` on *every* call — a full fan-out for even a trivial lookup.
When `ROBOTHOR_RIP_15_ENABLED` is set, it routes through
`robothor/memory/router.py`, which classifies the query (heuristics) and queries
only the stores that fit:

| Class | Stores | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `exact_lookup` | Knowledge Vault captions + facts | numbers, ids, addresses |
| `temporal` | facts + episodes | results recency-reordered (latest first) |
| `how_to` | procedures + facts | |
| `who_is` | facts + entity-graph expansion | |
| `intent` | standing intents + facts | |
| `default` | facts + insights | no episode/entity fan-out |

Results from each store are fused with the shared `rrf_fuse` (k=60, in
`robothor/memory/fusion.py`) and budget-capped. `search_facts()` keeps its
signature for back-compat; only the tool path changes.

## Symbolic short-term memory (RIP 13)

Long tool-heavy runs blow the context budget. Beyond the existing offload
(`session._offload_tool_result` writes large tool outputs to a tempfile),
`robothor/engine/symbolic_memory.py` encodes the run's tool activity as a compact
**Mermaid task-state graph** keyed by `node_id`. The agent reasons over the graph
and calls `recall_node(node_id)` to read the byte-exact output of any step on
demand (the TencentDB-Agent-Memory technique).

Modes (`feature_flags.symbolic_memory_mode`, env `ROBOTHOR_RIP_13_MODE`):

- `observe` (default when `ROBOTHOR_RIP_13_ENABLED=1`) — build the per-run graph
  and log the would-be token savings; injected context is **unchanged** (safe).
- `enforce` — the runner injects `render_injection_block()` in place of raw tool
  tails. (Wired once the runner refactor lands; observe-mode is the current rollout.)

Ratio knobs (ported from the source project): `ROBOTHOR_MEMORY_OFFLOAD_MILD_RATIO`
(0.5), `ROBOTHOR_MEMORY_OFFLOAD_AGGRESSIVE_RATIO` (0.85),
`ROBOTHOR_MEMORY_MMD_MAX_TOKEN_RATIO` (0.2). Tool: `recall_node` (readonly).

## Lifecycle

Nightly in `robothor/memory/lifecycle.py::run_lifecycle_maintenance`:

1. Importance scoring (LLM-judged, 200/run, 600s budget)
2. Decay computation (recency × access × reinforcement × importance × **outcome penalty**)
3. Garbage pruning (low decay + low importance + zero accesses)
4. Consolidation (similar facts merged, superseded via `is_active=FALSE`)
5. Unconsolidated sweep
6. Cross-domain insight discovery (72h window)
7. Cross-entity relationship inference
8. **Episode building** — cluster recent facts by time + entity overlap, LLM-title+summarize, embed
9. **Preference tracking** — extract from high-importance facts, detect drift (stale flag)
10. **Chat TTL** — delete 90d+ un-pinned, un-referenced verbatim turns
11. **Breadcrumb pruning + promotion** — hot breadcrumbs promoted to `memory_facts`
12. **Access log GC** — trim attribution history past 30d

## Outcome-Driven Invalidation

Every `search_memory` call logs fact IDs to `fact_access_log` keyed by `run_id`. When a run fails, `delivery.py` calls `bump_failure_for_run(run_id)` which increments `outcome_failures` on every fact the agent consulted. The decay scorer subtracts a per-failure penalty (capped at 0.4). Three or more failures also drop confidence. Self-correcting memory without dogmatic deletion.

## Generation Provider

All memory *generation* work (fact extraction, episode summaries, insight discovery, conflict classification, intent inference, preference distillation, consolidation) dispatches through one seam: `robothor.memory.generation`. It defaults to local Ollama, but `ROBOTHOR_MEMORY_GENERATION_PROVIDER=openrouter` offloads it to a remote model (`ROBOTHOR_MEMORY_GENERATION_REMOTE_MODEL`, default `openrouter/xiaomi/mimo-v2.5`) — useful when local generation saturates the GPU. Embeddings and reranking always stay local. Remote calls are paced (minimum interval between calls, `ROBOTHOR_MEMORY_GENERATION_MIN_INTERVAL_S`, default 1.5s) and rate-limit responses (429/503) are retried with jittered exponential backoff before giving up. Remote failures then fall back to local Ollama loudly: a WARNING containing `MEMORY_GENERATION_REMOTE_FALLBACK` plus the `generation.remote_fallback_count` counter — the marker fires only after retries are exhausted. See `docs/configuration.md` for the variables.

## Fact Store

Facts are atomic statements extracted from content via LLM. Each has:

- `fact_text` -- the statement itself
- `category` -- one of: `personal`, `project`, `decision`, `preference`, `event`, `contact`, `technical`
- `entities` -- array of named entities mentioned (text[])
- `confidence` -- 0.0 to 1.0
- `embedding` -- 1024-dim vector for semantic search
- `is_active` -- lifecycle flag (FALSE when superseded)
- `superseded_by` -- FK to the replacing fact

```python
from robothor.memory.facts import extract_facts, store_fact, search_facts

# Extract facts from raw text (LLM-powered)
facts = await extract_facts("Alice decided to use Redis for caching. Bob disagreed.")
# Returns: [
#   {"fact_text": "Alice decided to use Redis for caching", "category": "decision",
#    "entities": ["Alice", "Redis"], "confidence": 0.9},
#   {"fact_text": "Bob disagreed with Alice's caching decision", "category": "decision",
#    "entities": ["Bob", "Alice"], "confidence": 0.85},
# ]

# Store with embedding
fact_id = await store_fact(facts[0], source_content="...", source_type="email")

# Semantic search
results = await search_facts("what caching solution was chosen?", limit=5)
```

## Conflict Resolution

When a new fact arrives, the pipeline checks for similar existing facts:

1. **find_similar_facts** -- pgvector cosine search, threshold 0.7
2. **classify_relationship** -- LLM classifies as `new`, `duplicate`, `update`, or `contradiction`
3. **Act** -- store (new), skip (duplicate), or supersede (update/contradiction)

```python
from robothor.memory.conflicts import resolve_and_store

result = await resolve_and_store(
    fact={"fact_text": "The team switched from Redis to Memcached", ...},
    source_content="...",
    source_type="email",
)
# result["action"] is one of: "stored", "skipped", "superseded"
# If superseded: result["old_id"] points to the fact that was deactivated
```

## Lifecycle

Every fact has lifecycle columns that drive autonomous maintenance:

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `access_count` | Incremented on search hits |
| `last_accessed` | Updated on search hits |
| `importance_score` | LLM-judged (0.0-1.0) |
| `decay_score` | Computed: recency + access + reinforcement + importance |
| `reinforcement_count` | Incremented when fact is confirmed by new evidence |

**Decay formula:**

```
recency = exp(-hours_since_access * ln(2) / 72)    # 72h half-life
access_boost = min(ln(1 + access_count) / 5, 0.3)
reinforcement_boost = min(ln(1 + reinforcement_count) / 5, 0.2)
importance_floor = importance_score * 0.4
score = max(importance_floor, recency) + access_boost + reinforcement_boost
```

A fact with high importance can never fully decay (importance_floor). Frequently accessed facts resist decay via access_boost.

```python
from robothor.memory.lifecycle import compute_decay_score, run_lifecycle_maintenance

# Manual decay computation
score = compute_decay_score(
    last_accessed=some_datetime,
    access_count=5,
    reinforcement_count=2,
    importance_score=0.8,
)

# Run full maintenance (score importance, update decay)
stats = await run_lifecycle_maintenance()
# {"facts_scored": 12, "decay_updated": 350}
```

## Consolidation

Similar facts (cosine similarity >= 0.8) are grouped and merged into a single summary fact. The originals are deactivated.

```python
from robothor.memory.lifecycle import find_consolidation_candidates, consolidate_facts

groups = await find_consolidation_candidates(min_group_size=3, similarity_threshold=0.8)
for group in groups:
    result = await consolidate_facts(group)
    print(f"Merged {len(result['source_ids'])} facts into: {result['consolidated_text']}")
```

## Three-Tier Operations

```python
from robothor.memory.tiers import store_short_term, search_all_memory, run_maintenance

# Short-term (48h TTL)
mid = store_short_term("Meeting notes from standup...", content_type="conversation")

# Search across tiers (results sorted by similarity, tagged with tier)
results = search_all_memory("standup decisions", limit=10)

# Maintenance: archive expiring short-term, prune expired, run lifecycle
stats = run_maintenance()
# {"archived": 3, "deleted": 15, "lifecycle": {"facts_scored": 5, "decay_updated": 200}}
```

## Knowledge Vault (verbatim store, RIP 12)

`memory_facts` is LLM-extracted, so values are paraphrased — fine for "Alice
prefers Redis," unsafe for an account number or a credential. The Knowledge
Vault (`robothor/memory/vault.py`) preserves values **byte-for-byte**. It is
**not** the secrets vault (`robothor.vault` / `vault_secrets`); it is a
searchable, tenant-scoped memory store.

Safety invariants:

- Only the **caption** is embedded — the value is never vectorized.
- `memory_vault_search` returns captions + ids only, **never a value**; reading
  a value requires `memory_vault_get`, which writes a `vault_access_log` row.
- `high` sensitivity values are encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM via the shared
  `robothor.vault.crypto` master key); `low`/`medium` keep `value_exact`
  plaintext. A DB `CHECK` enforces exactly one of `value_exact` / `value_enc`.

```python
from robothor.memory import vault

# Store exact reference data (high → encrypted at rest)
await vault.store_vault_entry("FakeVendorCo support line", "555-0142 ext 7",
                              entry_type="contact_info", sensitivity="low")
# Find by description (no value returned), then read the exact value (audited)
hits = await vault.search_vault("vendor phone number")
vault.get_vault_value(hits[0]["id"])  # {"value": "555-0142 ext 7", ...}
```

Tools: `memory_vault_store`, `memory_vault_search` (readonly), `memory_vault_get`.
Gated by `ROBOTHOR_RIP_12_ENABLED` — tools stay dark and the table inert until
the operator opts in (restart the engine after toggling). Global kill switch:
`ROBOTHOR_DISABLE_ALL_RIPS=1`.

## Intent Memory (prospective, RIP 14)

Everything above is *retrospective*. `memory_intents` (`robothor/memory/intents.py`)
models what the operator is *working toward* and persists it across sessions, so
the main agent's heartbeat can advance standing objectives instead of only
reacting. It's parallel to `session_goal` (per-run, evidence-gated); intents are
longer-lived business objectives.

Confirmation model:

- `stated` intents (the operator/agent declared them) are `active` immediately.
- `inferred` intents (proposed by the nightly `infer_intents_from_facts` LLM pass)
  start as `proposed` and only become `active` via `confirm_intent(id, token)` with
  a valid HMAC token (`ROBOTHOR_INTENT_HMAC_SECRET`) — the agent never
  auto-activates a goal it invented.

The top active intents are injected into the warmup preamble (`active_intents`
section). When a `session_goal` linked to an intent completes, the intent's
`last_advanced_at` is bumped (loop closure); intents idle > 30 days go `dormant`.

Tools: `intent_add`, `intent_search` / `intent_list` (readonly), `intent_advance`.
Gated by `ROBOTHOR_RIP_14_ENABLED`.

## Knowledge Graph

Entities are upserted (mention_count increments on conflict). Relations link entities with typed edges.

```python
from robothor.memory.entities import (
    upsert_entity, add_relation, get_entity, get_all_about,
    extract_and_store_entities,
)

# Manual entity creation
alice_id = await upsert_entity("Alice", "person")
acme_id = await upsert_entity("Acme Corp", "organization")
await add_relation(alice_id, acme_id, "works_at", confidence=0.9)

# Get everything known about an entity
info = await get_all_about("Alice")
# {"entity": {..., "mention_count": 5}, "facts": [...], "relations": [...]}

# Auto-extract from text
stats = await extract_and_store_entities("Alice at Acme uses FastAPI", fact_id=42)
# {"entities_stored": 3, "relations_stored": 2}
```

## Ingestion Pipeline

The full pipeline: extract facts, resolve conflicts, build entity graph, track dedup state.

```python
from robothor.memory.ingestion import ingest_content

result = await ingest_content(
    content="The board approved the Q3 budget. CFO Jane Smith presented the numbers.",
    source_channel="email",
    content_type="decision",
    metadata={"email_id": "msg-123", "from": "cfo@example.com"},
)
```

Valid channels: `discord`, `email`, `cli`, `api`, `telegram`, `gchat`, `voice`, `mcp`, `camera`, `conversation`, `crm`.

## Dedup and Watermarks

Content hashing prevents re-processing the same data:

```python
from robothor.memory.ingest_state import content_hash, is_already_ingested, record_ingested

h = content_hash({"subject": "Q3 Budget", "body": "..."}, keys=["subject", "body"])
if not is_already_ingested("email", "msg-123", h):
    # Process and ingest
    record_ingested("email", "msg-123", h, fact_ids=[1, 2, 3])
```

## Memory Blocks

Named text blocks for structured agent working memory. Predefined blocks: `persona`, `user_profile`, `working_context`, `operational_findings`, `contacts_summary`. Each has a `max_chars` limit and usage tracking. Accessed via MCP tools (`memory_block_read`, `memory_block_write`) or direct SQL.
